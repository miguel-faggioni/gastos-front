* Personal expenses management
** Introduction
   This project was made to personally help me manage my monthly expenses by being a system where daily expenses can be recorded and then later monitored to check where all the money is going.

   Another side goal was to re-familiarize with Vue.js as a frontend framework.

   Its features include ways to:

   - input daily expenses, with its categories and expense type (fixed, variable, investment, or income);
   - download all the expenses as .csv or .xlsx;
   - register recurring monthly expenses that are automatically save on the given day of the month;
   - visualize the yearly or monthly expenses with graphs;

   A running instance of the project, together with [[https://github.com/miguel-faggioni/gastos-back][backend code]], can be found on https://anotar.coisa.online/.

** Installing and running the project
   After cloning the repository, install the needed packages with:
   #+begin_src bash
   yarn
   #+end_src

   Then to run the project locally run:
   #+begin_src bash
   yarn serve
   #+end_src

   This will make the system available on http://localhost:8080/.

   However it will access the backend running for https://anotar.coisa.online/, to point it to another backend, `axios.defaults.baseURL` must be updated on `src/plugins/axios.js` to the desired backend url. The repository for the backend can be found on https://github.com/miguel-faggioni/gastos-back.

     The sankey graph shows the flow of the cash for the given year or month, with the income coming in through the left, and the fixed, variable, and investments on the right.

**** Line graphs
     There are two line graphs, one where the expenses are split by their type:
     #+NAME:   fig:Line graph - expenses by type
     [[./imgs/line-by-type.png]]

     And another where they are split by their category:
     #+NAME:   fig:Line graph - expenses by category
     [[./imgs/line-by-category.png]]

** Self-hosting
   In order to build and deploy when self-hosting, some scripts on ~package.json~ must be updated:

   - ~deploy~
     - change ~anotar.coisa.online~ to the correct AWS S3 bucket
   - ~postdeploy~
     - change ~EYSHIAOAERFMG~ to the correct AWS CloudFront ID

   Then to build and deploy the code, run:
   #+begin_src bash
   yarn build
   yarn deploy
   #+end_src

** Contribution
   Any type of contribution is welcome, however since this is a side-project, I kindly ask of you to be patient in case there is any delay to respond to any issue or pull-request opened.
